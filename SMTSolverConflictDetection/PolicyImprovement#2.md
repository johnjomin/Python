Key Features of the Enhanced Structure
Flexible Parameters: You can add as many conditions as you want by listing them out, which makes it easy to expand and handle more complex logic.

Logical Operators:You can use AND, OR, and even NOT to combine conditions. This lets you create more complex rules directly within the policy.

Actions with Conditions:Actions can be set to only run if certain extra conditions are met, allowing them to respond to real-time data or specific scenarios.

Conflict Handling Options:Each policy can have its own rules for dealing with conflicts, like prioritizing based on importance or time created. This lets you customize how conflicts are resolved.

Detailed Metadata:Policies include extra information, like priority, status, and timestamps, which helps with tracking versions and analyzing conflicts over time.

Reusable Templates:You can use templates or aliases for common conditions, which makes it easier to reuse and reduces repetition.

Broad Operator Support:Conditions aren’t limited to simple comparisons; you can use a range of operators (like IN or BETWEEN) for checking within ranges or specific sets of values.

Benefits for Conflict Detection
Fits Well with Dependency Graphs:This setup works well with a dependency graph, which helps map relationships between conditions. You can quickly find cycles or paths that could lead to conflicts.

Quick Conflict Matching:With the way conditions are organized, it’s easy to spot where they overlap or contradict each other using patterns or templates.

Batch Processing Friendly:The structure allows you to check many policies at once, making it efficient for handling large numbers of policies in one go.
