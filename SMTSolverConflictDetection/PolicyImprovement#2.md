## Key Features of the Enhanced Structure
Modular and Dynamic Parameters:

Parameters are nested within a list of expressions, allowing for any number of conditions to be defined. This supports dynamic scaling and simplifies parsing.
Nested Logical Operators:

Supports nested logical expressions, allowing AND, OR, and potentially NOT operators to be combined within conditions.
This flexibility enables complex, compound conditions to be defined directly within the policy.
Actions with Execution Conditions:

Actions can have their own execution conditions, making them conditional on factors outside the top-level policy conditions. This allows for fine-grained control over actions based on real-time data.
Conflict Resolution Strategies:

Policies can define their own conflict resolution strategies, such as resolving conflicts based on priority, timestamp, or conflict_score. This structure supports dynamic conflict handling by allowing policies to specify how they should be prioritized.
Extensible Metadata:

Metadata includes fields like priority, enabled, and timestamps, supporting advanced features like versioning and historical tracking for better conflict analysis.
Enhanced Conditions with Aliases or Templates:

The parameter fields could be templated or aliased for frequently used conditions, enabling reusability and reducing redundancy.
Data Type and Operator Support:

Conditions can support various operators and data types. For instance, IN or BETWEEN operators could be added for range-based or set-based conditions.


## Benefits for Conflict Detection
Dependency Graph Compatibility:

This structure is well-suited for a dependency graph that maps parameter relationships. Each policyâ€™s conditions can be broken down into nodes and edges for quick cycle detection or conflict path analysis.
Fast Conflict Matching:

With modular conditions and structured logical operators, you can efficiently match overlapping or opposing conditions using pattern recognition or template matching.
Scalable for Batch Processing:

The flexible condition and action lists allow the entire policy set to be evaluated in batches, optimizing for large-scale conflict detection.
